Prepare your developer environment for programming with Python

Reflection Questions

1. 
In your own words, what is the difference between frontend and backend web development? 
If you were hired to work on backend programming for a web application, what kinds of operations would you be working on?
    ANSWER: 
    Front-end involves things that a user will interact with such as buttons, links, forms, animations, etc is all built using frontend tools such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
    Back-end involves things such as data storage and business logic. 
    As a back-end developer, I would be working with databases, authentication and authorization, hashing of sensitive information, APIs, etc.



2. 
Imagine you’re working as a full-stack developer in the near future.
Your team is asking for your advice on whether to use JavaScript or Python for a project, and you think Python would be the better choice.
How would you explain the similarities and differences between the two languages to your team?
Drawing from what you learned in this Exercise, what reasons would you give to convince your team that Python is the better option? 
(Hint: refer to the Exercise section “The Benefits of Developing with Python”)
    ANSWER:
    Both JavaScript and python are high level languages that aren't hard to comprehend and are dynamic typing. with python, the main benefit would be readabilty.
    As the project expands, other developers will have an easier time understanding the code, therefore reducing the time necessary to integrate new developers into the project.
    Also, python has built in package management and an active community that is always updating python. 

3.
